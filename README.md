This is a basic outline of an electronic trading algorithm in Java. Actual implementation will depend on the specific trading platform, instrument, and trading strategy being used. Additionally, it is important to consider best practices for handling sensitive financial data, such as encrypting user credentials and implementing secure communication protocols.
