Get recommended buy and strong buy stocks daily from Nasdaq.com and get prices from Yahoo and determine which stocks moved the most the previous n days, sort those by largest movers (based on open/close $) and buy those stocks if they are going up. When the stock price goes up enough, or at the end of the market day, sell any purchased stocks.


## Options

"lowtomarket" - uses low price to market price

"lowtohigh" - uses low price to high price

Buy time can bet set to:

"buyatopen" - buy the stocks when market opens and sell when price increases enough or at end of day, whatever comes first

"buyatclose" - buy the stocks before market closes, and hold until next day, if stock price goes up enough sell, or sell at end of next market day
